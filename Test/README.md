# About Me 
Hi i'm Marco, and I'm a junior in the BFA Design & Technology program. I originally studied communication design
with an emphasis in video and graphic design, but have been enjoying this recent forray into the life of code.

Some of my interests are interactive spaces, audio/visual projects, product design, architecture, sound,
generative art and more. I love grids / patterns / repetition. 

I'm originally from Singapore and also work with record label 'Darker Than Wax' for the last 5 years, having 
recently been featured by the likes of Adidas, Hypebeast and Boiler Room.

Looking forward to getting more into algorithms :)
